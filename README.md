# spaceman
Spaceman is a word guessing game, where the player has a limited amount of single letter guesses, 
after the guesses are exhausted the player has lost.  If the player has guessed every letter of the word
the game is one. 

I chose a simple layout and design that would be easy to understand and work efficiently.  
I remember playing games like this in elementary school as an educational tool.  these games always had a simple 
block based layout with simple colors.  I also chose to use five letter words, so that the words would not be to 
complex for a younger audience.

# function
The play is prompted to choose a letter,  after choosing that letter it will dissapear from the 
letters area, either the letter is added to the correct letters area.  If the letter was incorrect the game
will remove one part of the spacemans body.  Once all body parts are gone the game is lost.

# Future additions
Give the player an option to choose a difficulty level between easy, medium and hard.  Easy would 5 letter 
words,  medium would be 7 letter words,  and hard would be 8 letter words. 

I would also like to add a game timer.  The timer would count down from 30 seconds, and at the end of the
time,  the game is lost.
